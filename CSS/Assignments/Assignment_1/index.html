    <h2>What is css?</h2>

    <ol type="numbers">
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <br>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are displayed on screen,paper,or in another media.</li>
        <br>
        <li><span class="td">CSS is not necessary</span><span class="thr">CSS saves a lot of work.</span>It can control the layout
            of multiple
            web pages all at once</li>
        <br>
        <li><span class="spanText">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</span></li>
        <br>
    </ol>
    <h2 >CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <div id="ulList">
        <ul>
            <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements 1</li>
            <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
            <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS files.</li>
           <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <span class="th">in this<br>tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span>because this is easier
                to demonstrate, and easier you to try it yourself.</li>

        </ul>
    </div>
   <div class="lastPara">
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID,the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID,on the
        other hand,applies a style to one unique element,ID is also special in that you csn use a special URL to link
        directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
    <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page.Once an element has
        been targeted,a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
    <p>There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to
        target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
