        <li>CSS stands for Cascanding Style Sheets.</li><br>
        <li>Css describes how HTML,elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li><br>
        <li><s>Css is not neccessary</s> CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at
            once</li><br>
        <li>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML document ion 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul style="list-style-type: style type disc;">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML element</li>
        <li>Internal - by isiong a style element yo link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most conmmon way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <span>In this
                tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and
            easier for you to try yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID, on the
        other hand, applies a style to one unique element,ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link
        directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
    <p>In CSS, selector are used to target a specific element or range of element on a web page. Once an element has
        been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
    <p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID, Both are used to
        target element which a style shoulkd be applied.</p>
